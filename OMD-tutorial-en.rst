Step-by-step guide for a system monitoring installation and initial
configuration using Nagios and `Check_MK`_ collection of extensions for Nagios.
We will use the pre-packaged `Open Monitoring Distribution (OMD)`_ system which
bundles both Nagios and Check_MK, as well as many other Nagios extensions into
a single, pre-configured package and brings the setup, configuration and
maintenance of the monitoring system to a new level of simplicity.

We will use two CentOS virtual machines (`VMs`) to be able follow this 
tutorial, but
the same procedure should be applicable with minimal changes to any of the
distributions supported by OMD.

Required software
=================

 * VirtualBox, version 4.3.6, has been used througout the tutorial:

     Virtualization software https://www.virtualbox.org/

     CentOS Virtual Machines from  http://virtualboxes.org/images/centos/

 * Virtual Machine for the OMD server: CentOS 6.3 with GNOME desktop graphical environment

    http://sourceforge.net/projects/virtualboximage/files/CentOS/6.3/CentOS-6.3-x86.7z

 * Virtual Machine to be monitored: CentOS 5.7 base

    http://sourceforge.net/projects/virtualboximage/files/CentOS/5.7/CentOS-5.7-i386.7z

 * Open Monitoring Distribution - OMD, version 1.10 

    http://omdistro.org/

 * Check_MK 

    Collection of Nagios extensions / plugins, already integrated in OMD.
   
    Check_MK  monitoring and inventory agent to be installed in the monitored
    systems  http://mathias-kettner.com/check_mk.html, version 1.2.2p3.

VirtualBox configuration
========================

The two virtual machines we are using are (see
http://virtualboxes.org/images/centos/)


**CentOS 5.7 base x86**

:Size: (compressed/uncompressed) 173 MBytes / 1.3 GBytes
:Link: http://sourceforge.net/projects/virtualboximage/files/CentOS/5.7/CentOS-5.7-i386.7z
:Active user account(s): (username/password) root/reverse.
:Notes: text mode installed, no graphics


**CentOS 6.3 Gnome Desktop x86** 

:Size: (compressed/uncompressed) 492 MBytes / 2.2 GBytes
:Link: http://sourceforge.net/projects/virtualboximage/files/CentOS/6.3/CentOS-6.3-x86.7z
:Active user account(s): (username/password) root/reverse, centos/reverse.
:Notes: GNOME desktop environement, install from LiveCD; Guest Additions NOT installed.


Now we download the virtual machines, extract them and open the corresponding 
``.vbox`` files from the VirtualBox Manager ``( Machine | Add )``.

.. note::
  
  If we get an error about the disc UUID already being used (eg. because we
  just copied this virtual machine for another test) we have to change the 
  ``.vdi`` virtual disk UUID with the command:: 

    VBoxManage internalcommands sethduuid CentOS-5.7.vdi

  and update the "HardDisk uuid" section in the configuration file ``.vbox``.


Internal network configuration
------------------------------

We want to set up an internal network for the virtual machines to be able to 
communicate each other. 

First we make sure we have an internal network configured in the VirtualBox 
server ``(VirtualBox Manager -> File | Preferences | Network | Host-only 
Networks )``. Make sure you have:

**PC VirtualBox Host**

:IP: 192.168.56.1


We also have to add a ``Host-only Adapter`` to each virtual machine ``(Virtual 
Machine Manager: select the VM -> settings | network | Adapter 2 |  Enable + 
attached to "Host-only Adapter")``. 

From the "Advanced" section We write down the network "card" MAC address in 
order to later set up static IP addresses whithin the internal network.  In 
this case the MACs we have and IPs we will use are:

**CentOS 6.3 - OMD monitoring server**

:MAC: 08:00:27:C1:99:2D
:IP:  192.168.56.10


**CentOS 5.7 - monitored system**

:MAC: 08:00:27:42:79:DF
:IP:  192.168.56.11


Monitoring Server configuration and Nagios / OMD install
========================================================

Network configuration
---------------------

After booting the virtual machine first enable ssh access as it is disabled by default::

    chkconfig ssh on
    service sshd on


Then setup the static IP by creating the file ``/etc/sysconfig/network-scripts/ifcfg-eth1``::

    #/etc/sysconfig/network-scripts/ifcfg-eth1
    DEVICE=eth1
    BOOTPROTO=none
    IPADDR=192.168.56.10
    NETMASK=255.255.255.0
    ONBOOT=yes
    HWADDR=08:00:27:C1:99:2D
    DEFROUTE=yes
    NAME="eth1"

and restart the network::

    service network restart


email sending configuration
---------------------------

First lets check whether we already can send emails straigth from postfix over 
port 25:: 

    echo "Test mail from postfix" | mail -s "Test Postfix" user@domain

If we do not get the message at user@domain check the postfix log at
``/var/log/maillog``. In this case it may be necessary to set up a relay host
for postfix in ``/etc/ postfix/main.cf``. We can eg. use Google SMTP servers
for testing. 

.. note::

    Use ``tail -f /var/log/maillog`` while testing to see the postfix 
    behaviour. In order to check/clean the postfix queue use ``mailq`` and 
    ``postsuper -d ALL`` commands. 


Postfix relay using Gmail
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

We follow the guide at 
http://blog.earth-works.com/2013/05/14/postfix-relay-using-gmail-on-centos/, 
with a summarized version reproduced here just for completeness.

Install SASL nedded modules::

    yum install cyrus-sasl-plain

Create ``/etc/postfix/sasl_passwd`` with just one line (adapt to your gmail
user data)::

    smtp.gmail.com     GmailUsername:GmailPassword

Secure the thing::

    chown postfix /etc/postfix
    postmap hash:/etc/postfix/sasl_passwd
    chown root:root /etc/postfix/sasl_passwd*
    chmod 640 /etc/postfix/sasl_passwd*

Edit the ``/etc/postfix/main.cf`` configuration file, and add the following lines
at the end::

    #Set the relayhost to the Gmail SMTP server
    relayhost = smtp.gmail.com:587

    #Set the required TLS options
    smtp_tls_security_level = secure
    smtp_tls_mandatory_protocols = TLSv1
    smtp_tls_mandatory_ciphers = high
    smtp_tls_secure_cert_match = nexthop

    #Check that this path exists -- these are the certificates used by TLS
    smtp_tls_CAfile = /etc/pki/tls/certs/ca-bundle.crt

    #Set the sasl options
    smtp_sasl_auth_enable = yes
    smtp_sasl_password_maps = hash:/etc/postfix/sasl_passwd
    smtp_sasl_security_options = noanonymous

Restart postfix service::

    service postfix restart

Test::

    echo "Test email from postfix with Gmail relay" | mail -s "Gmail-postfix test" user@domain


OMD installation
----------------

We follow the quickstart CentOS installation instructions straigth from the OMD
web page at http://omdistro.org/doc/quickstart_redhat just adapting everything
to our CentOS version (6) and architectura (i386).

First install the ``epel`` repository configuration ::

    rpm -Uvh http://download.fedoraproject.org/pub/epel/6/i386/epel-release-6-8.noarch.rpm

and then download and install the ~100MB OMD rpm package::

    wget http://files.omdistro.org/releases/centos_rhel/omd-1.10-rh61-31.i386.rpm
    yum install --nogpgcheck omd-1.10-rh61-31.i386.rpm

In our case this installs 36 packages and upgrades 4, with a total download 
size of 24MB.

.. note::

   We could have instead used the Consol* Labs  OMD repository in order to have the latest version available at hand. Setting it up is trivial, just follow the guidelines at https://labs.consol.de/repo/stable.


OMD initial setup
-----------------

The ``omd`` command is used to manage OMD sites. ``omd`` can be executed as 
site user to modify just that site, or as root user. As the root user ``omd`` 
offers more option such as copying, renaming, disabling or uninstalling sites.  
Calling ``omd`` alone provides  see a list of options.


OMD site creation and access
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To create and start a new OMD test "site" instance just::

    omd create test
    omd start test

When creating a new `site` OMD, amongst other things, creates a new user in the 
system which will be used to manage this specific site. Thus we can have 
different `sites` for different purposes as testing, production, upgrading, 
etc. (see http://mathias-kettner.com/checkmk_install_with_omd.html)

In order to manage our site we just ``su -`` to the site/user::

    su - test

The ``test`` user home directory is ``/omd/sites/test``. Here all the local 
configurations, caches, performance data, etc. for this site will be kept, 
specifically in the ``tmp``, ``var`` and ``etc`` directories (the rest of the 
directories are symlinked to your OMD version.  See 
http://mathias-kettner.com/checkmk_install_with_omd.html for a detailled 
description of the file/folder structure and contents.


Web server access configuration
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. note::

    Default user/password for the OMD interface is **omdadmin/omd**

Once the test site is up we try to access to it web interface from within the 
own machine first at http://localhost/test. In our case we get a error "OMD: 
Site not started". This is documented in the OMD FAQ specifically for CentOS 
and related systems and it is related to the selinux configuration. Just do::

    /usr/sbin/setsebool -P httpd_can_network_connect 1

``-P`` makes the change persistent and it may take a while to run, even some 
minutes, so be patient. After this we can access the web interface from the 
localhost without problems.

If we want to access to the web interface from remote machines (as the 
VirtualBox physical host in this case) we have to enable the service in the 
CentOS firewall, activated by default. Just run::

    /usr/bin/system-config-firewall-tui

go to *Customise* (<TAB> moves between fields), scroll down the list up to *WWW 
(HTTP)* and enable the service with <SPACE>. Then select *Close*, *OK* and 
*YES*.

Now you can access the OMD web interface at http://192.168.56.10  eg. from your 
VirtualBox physical host.


Monitorized system configuration
================================

After booting the machine (CentOS-5.7) up we just set the static IP and
then install the ``check_mk`` agent.


Network configuration
---------------------

As before, in order to set up a static IP we create the file ``/etc/sysconfig/network-scripts/ifcfg-eth1``::

    #/etc/sysconfig/network-scripts/ifcfg-eth1
    DEVICE=eth1
    BOOTPROTO=none
    IPADDR=192.168.56.11
    NETMASK=255.255.255.0
    ONBOOT=yes
    HWADDR=08:00:27:42:79:DF
    DEFROUTE=yes
    NAME="eth1"

and restart the network::

    service network restart


check_mk agent installation
---------------------------

We download and install the ``check_mk`` monitoring agent from the check_mk
webpage without further complications, the only needed dependence being 
``xinetd``::

    wget http://mathias-kettner.com/download/check_mk-agent-1.2.2p3-1.noarch.rpm
    wget http://mathias-kettner.com/download/check_mk-agent-logwatch-1.2.2p3-1.noarch.rpm
    yum install --nogpgcheck check_mk-agent-1.2.2p3-1.noarch.rpm \
        check_mk-agent-logwatch-1.2.2p3-1.noarch.rpm


If desired we can restrict the access to the agent execution in this machine to
the OMD monitoring service so we have a more secure setup eg. in a
production environment.  In order to do this we just add to the
``/etc/xinetc.d/check_mk`` file the line::

    $> vim /etc/xinetc.d/check_mk
    ...
    only_from = 192.168.56.10
    ...

and we reload the ``xinetd`` daemon configuration::

    $>/etc/init.d/xinetd reload


Hard disk monitoring with S.M.A.R.T.
------------------------------------

If we are monitoring a physical host we will be interested in monitoring their 
hard disk health status. Check_mk does not includes S.M.A.R.T. checking by 
default, but provides a ``plugin`` that has to be explicitly installed in the 
remote host.

The plugin is called ``smart`` and it already is in the OMD server, we just 
have to copy over to the desired host::

    # su - test
    # scp ~/share/check_mk/agents/plugins/smart  \
          user@remote-host:/usr/lib/check_mk_agent/plugins/smart

If we have not yet inventorized the host the smart check will be present when 
doing it, otherwise you have to reinventorize it and the new check will appear.  
Will see later how to do it.


Basic Check_MK configuration
============================

We will do the basic monitoring system setup using at first *WATO - Check_MK's 
Web Administrator Tool* through the *Multisite* web interface, both part of the 
Check_MK echosystem.

We will first setup a new user who will get the test alerts and after this we 
will add the hosts to be monitored ann test some alerts.


User creation
-------------

Every user (*contact* in the Nagios nomenclature) belongs to a *contact group*, 
which are the ones which are really assigned to host and services 
notifications.  In the default OMD/check_MK configuration we have only one 
contact group, **"Everybody"**, so we will add the new contact to this group, 
also making sure that we check the **"Administrator"** role in the Security 
section and that we **"enable notifications"** in the notifications section::

     ( WATO-Configuration | Users & Contacts | New User )


We save the changes (**"Save"** in the lower part of the new user creation 
form) and we are bougth back to the "User & Contacts" main section, where we 
have a notice about the **"1 Changes"**  done. In order to propagate the change 
to the Check_MK/Nagios configuration click on the **"1 Changes"** button and 
then on the **"Activate Changes!"** one. We can now see the newly created user 
in the "Users & Contacts " WATO section and also can checks that the user is a 
member of the "Everybody" group in the "Contact Goups" section.


Integration (inventory) of the new *host* to be monitored
----------------------------------------------------------

In order to add (inventorize, in the Check_MK slang) a new host (in which we 
have already installed the check_mk agent), we just::

    ( WATO-Configuration | Hosts & Folders | New host )

There we just add the **"Hostname"** (CentOS-5.7), **"IP"** if needed 
(192.168.56.11 in this case), **"Permissions" -> "Everybody"** and **"Alias"** 
(if desired).  Clicking on **"Save & go to Services"** brings us to the 
autodetected host services list, where we can choose to ignore some of the 
automatically detected checks.  We then **"Save manual check configuration"** 
and as we did before we **"Activate Changes!"**.

Going to the main web interface page (Check_MK logo in the upper left or 
``(Views | Dashboards |  Main Overview)`` we see that we have one host and 19 
services monotirized.

..note::
    
    It is convenient to use the own monitoring server to monitor itself. For 
    this we just install the check_mk agent in the server and add the host 
    *localhost* in WATO. Do it!


Reinventoring
-------------

If we add new checks to a host through check_mk plugins, legacy nagios checks, 
NRPE nagios checks, etc., we can make Check_MK to scan this host for new, not 
inventorized services. Just go to ``(WATO | Hosts & Folders )``, click on the 
desired host and then select "Services" and "Full Scan". New services will be 
detected and you can enable them at will, as well as disable existing checks if 
wanted.

.. note::
    
    When reinventoring a host all previously inventorized checks, performance 
    data, graphs, etc. are kept.


email notification test
-----------------------

In order to test email notifications go to a host ``( Views | Hosts | All hosts 
)`` and click on a service name. In the service information page click on the 
hammer icon in order to run commands over this service. Then go to **"Various 
Commands" -> "Fake check results"** and eg. click **"Critical**". Confirm the 
action and see eg. in the ``Dashboard | Main Overview`` the service being 
Critical for a while and the notifications being sent. Check you email for the 
Critical State notification and the Recovery one a minute later when the 
service comes back to normal state!
